# Summarize my numbers for me!

## Reading charts are hard

\[Temporary\] The text you see here is Qxf2 trying out GitBook for all our repositories. Given that this repo has not yet been worked on, we are going to make it a guinea pig. Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
